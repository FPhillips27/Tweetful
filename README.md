=============

##Overview
###Outline

This is my modified version of "Tweetful" which was created for the Thinkful course "Essentials of Full Stack Development in Rails."
I cloned from https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/Tweetful which was provided by the course.

#####My contributions to my modified version are:
* Creating the team page (per the curriculum's instructions)
* Creating the about page (per the curriculum's instructions)
* Adding feature files
* Modifying CSS pertaining to
 * The app's background (per the curriculum's instructions)
 * Current User Info Box
 * Tweet display
 * The initial login page you see if you attempt to access Tweetful without being logged in.
 * Tweetful logo
* Added Cucumber Tests

It was a valuable learning process. This excercise walked me through understanding and modified Dynamic Views within a Rails app for the first time. I had a HTML and CSS background prior to this course, but it was mindblowing to me the first time I learned I can combine Ruby code with HTML.

The possibilities are endless!

##Visual Styling
Here are screenshots illustrating how big of a change occurred in the CSS between the initial version of Tweetful and my fork.
