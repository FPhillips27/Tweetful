###Outline

This is my modified version of "Tweetful. "Tweetful" is a stripped down version of Twitter. I created it as part of the Thinkful course "Essentials of Full Stack Development in Rails."

I cloned it from Thinkful's repo https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/Tweetful.

You can view the most recent stable release of my fork on Heroku:

#####My contributions to my modified version are:
* Creating the team page (per the curriculum's instructions)
* Creating the about page (per the curriculum's instructions)
* Adding feature files
* Modifying CSS pertaining to
 * The app's background (per the curriculum's instructions)
 * Current User Info Box
 * Tweet display
 * The initial login page you see if you attempt to access Tweetful without being logged in.
 * Tweetful logo
* Added Cucumber Tests

It was a valuable learning process. Creating my version of Tweetful showed me how to understand and change Dynamic Views in Rails. My front-end background before this course was in HTML and CSS so I was happy to learn I can combine Ruby and HTML.

The possibilities are endless!
